Odd Soot is supported but does not have a sheet of it's own.  Instead you should use the Mythras sheet, which has full support for the Odd Soot setting, plus the ability to incorporate various rules and systems from other Mythras based products.

### Instructions:
1. Open your campaign page and goto Settings->Game Settings.
2. Change the Character Sheet Template to Mythras.
3. There are also a number of other Default Sheet Settings used to toggle optional rules and systems. You may optionally set these as you wish.
4. When done click Save Changes.
